What's bothersome about traditional centralized version control
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Built for a time when projects were small, and teams were small and
  colocated
* All version control functionality is handled at the server (depends on
  server for you to "save" your work)
* You need a centralized server...this means you need dedicated systems
  administrator, backup procedures, and all that other jazz.
* All of the version history is stored on the central server! If it goes down
  and your backups fail, you've lost your entire repository history!

What bother's me about subversion
---------------------------------

* All those .svn directories everywhere (or CVS). Messy.
* Branch control...there really is none.
* Simple operations like deleting a file are unnecessarily complex.
* IDE integration works, but it's not perfect and subject to SCM versioning
  issues.
